# Backlog

## Near-term

- [ ] Run the first interview session (childhood or another chosen chapter).
- [ ] Save the raw transcript and create the first session_* files.
- [ ] Extract events and update autobio_timeline.json.
- [ ] Generate the first real content in autobio_draft_v01.md.

## Medium-term

- [ ] Add simple tooling (scripts or helper prompts) to:
  - [ ] Merge overlapping events.
  - [ ] Visualise the timeline.
- [ ] Experiment with different chapter structures (chronological vs thematic).
- [ ] Note requirements that seem relevant to the future “retiring experts” system.

## Long-term ideas

- [ ] Generalise this system to capture professional tacit knowledge.
- [ ] Add RAG over personal documents, photos (metadata only), etc.
- [ ] Explore multi-agent orchestration if needed (separate interviewer / biographer / analyser processes).
