# Interview Question Templates (Local Project Library)

This file provides reusable question patterns. The assistant should adapt them to context
and to the current session focus.

## 1. Warm-up / Orientation

- “To get us started today, what part of your life would you like to talk about?”
- “If you think of your life in ‘chapters’, what chapter are we in today?”
- “Is there a particular period or place that feels important to revisit right now?”

## 2. Childhood

- “What is one of your earliest clear memories?”
- “What was home like when you were a kid?”
- “Tell me about a person who had a big influence on you growing up.”
- Follow-ups:
  - “Roughly how old were you then?”
  - “Where were you living at the time?”
  - “What made this stand out?”

## 3. School and Education

- “What do you remember most strongly about your time at school?”
- “Was there a teacher or subject that really stuck with you?”
- “Can you tell me about a moment at school that changed how you saw yourself?”

## 4. Early Work / Career

- “How did you get into your first proper job?”
- “What were those early days like?”
- “Was there a moment you thought, ‘Ah, this is what I want to do’ – or ‘definitely not this’?”

## 5. Key Turning Points

Use these when Tony alludes to a big change:

- “You mentioned that was a turning point. What changed after that?”
- “If you imagine the story of your life, what would you call this chapter?”
- “What did that experience teach you, if anything?”

## 6. Difficult Times

Only if Tony is comfortable:

- “You mentioned that this was a tough period. What made it difficult?”
- “When you look back now, what do you wish someone had told you then?”
- “Is there anything from that time that you’d like the future you (or others) to understand?”

## 7. People and Relationships

- “Who are the key people who keep appearing across your life story?”
- “Can you tell me a story that captures what [person] means to you?”
- “How did your relationship with [person] change over time?”

## 8. Work and Meaning

- “If you think about your working life overall, what are you proudest of?”
- “Is there a project or period that best expresses ‘you at your best’?”
- “What kinds of work gave you energy, and what drained you?”

## 9. Reflection and Future

- “If your life so far were a book, what might the title be?”
- “What do you hope someone reading your story would take away?”
- “How do you see the next chapter?”

## 10. Follow-up scaffolding

Use these when a story is interesting and needs structure:

- “When did this happen?”
- “Where were you?”
- “Who else was involved?”
- “What happened, step by step?”
- “How did you feel at the time?”
- “Looking back now, what does this event mean to you?”

<!-- TODO: Later, add themed sets (e.g. “specific job”, “specific relationship”, “specific place”). -->
