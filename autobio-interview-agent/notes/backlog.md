# Backlog – Autobiographical Interview Agent

## Near-term

- [ ] Run the first interview session (choose a focus: childhood, a specific period, or a theme).
- [ ] Save the raw transcript and create the first `session_*.md` and `session_*.json` files.
- [ ] Extract events from the first session and update `autobio_timeline.json`.
- [ ] Generate the first real content in `autobi_draft_v01.md` from the timeline.

## Medium-term

- [ ] Add light tooling (prompts or helper scripts) to:
  - [ ] Merge overlapping/duplicate events across sessions.
  - [ ] Visualise the timeline (e.g. sorted by year, by domain, by life_stage).
- [ ] Experiment with different chapter structures (chronological vs thematic).
- [ ] Note requirements that seem relevant to the future “retiring experts” system.

## Long-term ideas

- [ ] Generalise this system to capture professional tacit knowledge.
- [ ] Add RAG over personal documents, photos (metadata only), etc.
- [ ] Explore multi-agent orchestration if needed (separate interviewer / biographer / analyser processes).

<!-- TODO: As usage grows, split this into separate backlogs for interview UX, analysis, and writing. -->
