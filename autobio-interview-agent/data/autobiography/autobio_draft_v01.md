# Autobiography Draft – v0.1

_This is an automatically-assisted first draft.  
As interviews continue, this document will be revised and expanded._

At the moment, this file is mostly a **placeholder**. As sessions are recorded and analysed:

- `data/sessions/*_structured.json` will accumulate individual events.
- `data/autobiography/autobio_timeline.json` will merge those into a life-wide timeline.
- This draft will be generated and refined using the chapter structure in
  `prompts/biography_outline_template.md`.

The target voice is:

- First person.
- Close to Tony’s natural way of speaking.
- Factually careful, not melodramatic.

<!-- The assistant will populate this based on autobio_timeline.json and biography_outline_template.md -->
