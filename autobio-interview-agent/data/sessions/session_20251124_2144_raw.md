**Assistant:**  
If we start with your mum, what do you know about where she came from and what her early life was like—where she grew up, her family, the kind of person she was before you were born?

**Tony:**  
My Mum, Diane, was born in Willesden, London in 1942. She was the youngest sibling with 2 brothers and 1 sister. Arthur, her brother, was work friends with my Dad, Ron, and this is how they met. She left school early to help provide some income to the family and became a hairdresser through an apprenticeship. She spent some of her youth looking after Arthur's daughter Lynne, who became BA’s first female pilot. When she met my dad, they married in 1964 and moved to Feltham and had my brother Dave in 1965. She was always a most agreeable person, and spent a lot of her youth shrinking on skinny jeans, going to jazz clubs, and even went to a party with the Kray twins at one point.

**Assistant:**  
If you think of one specific scene that really captures who she was as a person—either from before you were born (from stories) or from your childhood—what’s a moment that feels like “that’s Diane, through and through”? What’s happening, who’s there, and what does it show about her?

**Tony:**  
When my dad asked her out, he said, “Do you drink?” Her answer was “Yes, but not like a fish.”

**Assistant:**  
What do you know about your dad’s background before they met—where he grew up, his family, what sort of work he did, and what kind of young man he was from the stories you’ve heard or your own sense of him?

**Tony:**  
My dad was born in Isleworth, Greater London in 1937. He had a younger sister, also called Diane, and lived with his mum and dad. His dad was a general builder, and he passed some of those skills on. He was interested in cars from a young age and bought and repaired his own cars from a young age. He did national service after the war and became a corporal and on return got to pick his job at the job centre and became a sheet metal worker. This is where he met Arthur. He also was a very agreeable person.

**Assistant:**  
When you think about Diane and Ron together as a couple in those early Feltham years, what’s a scene or habit that captures their dynamic—how they were with each other, or how they were together with you and Dave?

**Tony:**  
When they got their first house, they had a strong make‑do attitude and were pushing themselves financially. They had one TV with a picture and no sound and another with sound and no picture. They used tea crates for furniture and many things in the house were made by my dad. They didn’t really argue and this created a strong sense in the family that you could move forward without conflict and also they very much respected what other people wanted to do; there was no judgement that you should or shouldn’t do one thing or another.
