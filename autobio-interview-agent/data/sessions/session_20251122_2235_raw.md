**Assistant:**  
Before we dive into specific memories, what part of your life would you like this first session to focus on—for example childhood, school years, early work/career, or a particular period or theme that feels alive for you right now?

**Tony:**  
I feel like I should just start by talking about some basic info about what I know from when I was born, but only for 15 minutes to start with, just to get us going.

**Assistant:**  
When you think about the circumstances around your birth and your very earliest years, what are the key things you know or have been told—for example where you were born, roughly when, and anything your family has said about that time?

**Tony:**  
I was born on the 26th of January 1968 at Home 64 Denison Road in Feltham, Middlesex—that's FELTHAM.  
My mother was Diane Barfoot, née Burrows, and my father was James Barfoot. They were both Londoners: my father was born and grew up in Isleworth and my mum in Kensal Green.  
They met through my uncle Arthur Burrows, who was my mum’s brother. My dad worked with Arthur in, I guess, the late 50s—they both worked in a metalworking factory—and they became friends over the hobby of photography.  
So I was born at home. I believed it was during the first moon landing (would be interesting to check those dates).  
My brother was three years older than me, David; he was born on the 5th of February 65, I believe. While I was being born my dad had got my brother a cowboy outfit and dressed him up and took some photos of him. We have those photos still. This was to distract him while my mum was giving birth to me.  
My mum had a spot on her leg arrive when David was born and another spot on her leg arrive when I was born and she claimed that they were caused by that.

**Assistant (note):**  
The first Moon landing (Apollo 11) was July 1969, so Tony’s birth in January 1968 was a bit before that, though in the space‑race era.

**Assistant:**  
When you picture that house on Denison Road and those very early years with your parents and David, what kind of atmosphere comes to mind—what did it feel like to be a very small child in that family?

**Tony:**  
I find it hard to remember what age I was for some of these old memories.  
I do remember a Christmas morning when it snowed and my dad pretended that Father Christmas had left the presents in a pillowcase.  
I remember getting a toy dog called Taxi that would bark and do a flip.  
I generally remember it as being quite happy. My mum used to describe me as a happy baby.  
My mum didn’t work when we were young; she went back to work when I was about 10, although she was a hairdresser and did local women’s hair as a sideline throughout.  
The house was a three‑bedroom terrace in London with a long back garden. It had a shed down the end where my dad did work and an area behind that where there were some trees. I remember we used to have an Anderson shelter behind it and my dad once built a kiln to fire pottery. He was always doing one project or another.  
I do vividly remember on a Sunday when my mum was cooking the Sunday dinner we used to have to go out in the back garden through the kitchen and we had to edge along the wall as a sort of joke that we weren’t allowed in while she was cooking the dinner.  
I remember we had a gas fire in the living room and we used to come down and get dressed in front of it in the winter to stay warm.  
I generally remember that period as being happy. I don’t remember any particular friction until a little bit later.

**Assistant:**  
If you pick one specific scene from that period—for example that snowy Christmas morning with the pillowcase presents, or a Sunday with your mum cooking dinner while you edge along the wall—can you walk me through it as if it’s a short film? What room you’re in, what you see, who’s there, any sounds or smells, and how you felt in that moment.

**Tony:**  
I remember a Christmas when I think my parents were halfway through decorating the living room so there were floorboards there and I got some Lego for Christmas.  
I made what I called “the money box” and it had a slot in the top and then it had another slot bit down and somehow I managed to convince everyone that they needed to put their money in it and if it went through, I kept it and if it popped out the side then they got it back.  
My nan was there. My mum’s mum came over every Sunday for dinner. We used to go and get her from the other side of London—she was in Willesden—but over Christmas she would stay, and I’d go around first thing extorting money from them.  
My dad would be there; my mum would probably be in the kitchen and then out in the kitchen I know I would help. I remember my nan defeathering a turkey on Christmas morning for them. She was a kind of warm, kindly lady.  
My brother was there; me and him used to play a lot and probably would have been playing. I remember vividly one of our games was wrestling where we’d push the furniture back and then mimic wrestling like we watched on Sunday afternoons on the TV. It was all pretty good‑natured.  
I also remember playing with my brother while my mum had a Freeman’s catalogue and we’d go through the catalogue and look at each page and say what thing we’d have off that page, obviously aspiring to be rich.

**Assistant:**  
Looking back now, what do you think those early Christmases and that Denison Road family setup “taught” you about the world or about yourself—even if you only see it in hindsight (for example about money, play, creativity, or what family is like)?

**Tony:**  
My mum was very strongly of the view that you should be yourself. The only thing that mattered was being happy and healthy. She really instilled that.  
Although I grew up something of an anxious, frightened child about the world, she really didn’t do anything other than be supportive about it.  
I think she definitely taught me to be open and accepting of other people and that real sort of strong sense of morality and what’s important in the world.  
Dad was a good man. He did have a significant period of fracture with my brother which it took him a while to resolve in his head, but my overriding memory is of him being a good man who was quite open and giving.  
I remember play‑fighting with him on the sofa. He once had hold of my wrist and let go of it and that led to me punching him in the mouth and knocking a tooth out, which led to quite a bit of blood and having to head to the dentist. I wasn’t in trouble for that, and that goes to the whole atmosphere of being quite open and accepting.  
I do recognise that my perception of all this is different to my brother’s, but I can only call it as I see it.

**Assistant:**  
Is there anything else from those very early Denison Road years—a person, place, object, or small ritual—that feels important to mention because it still echoes in who you are now?

**Tony:**  
We had—my mum had—many friends across the road, down the road, round the corner. As I said, she did a lot of hairdressing. One of those families was the Bolton family and their daughter Joan was very similar in age to me and she was definitely a friend of mine when we were quite young and had some informative years and experiences together playing.  
I think that will do for today.
