At one point they had one TV with a picture but no sound and another with sound but no picture, effectively combining them. They used tea crates as furniture, and many items in the house were made by Ron himself. They rarely argued, which created a powerful sense for Tony that progress and change did not require conflict. They respected what other people wanted to do and were non‑judgemental about choices, conveying that there was no single right path one 'should' follow.",
