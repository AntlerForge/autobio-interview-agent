    "description": "Tony was born at home on 26 January 1968 at 64 Denison Road in Feltham, Middlesex. His parents, Diane (née Burrows) and James, were Londoners from Kensal Green and Isleworth. They met through Diane's brother Arthur, working together in a metalworking factory and bonding over photography. Tony's older brother David was three years older, and was given a cowboy outfit and photographed by their dad during Tony's birth to keep him occupied. Tony recalls family stories, such as his mum linking spots on her leg to the births of her sons.",

His mum, a hairdresser who did local women's hair as a sideline, did not work outside the home until he was about 10. The family lived in a three-bedroom terrace with a long back garden, a shed where his dad worked on projects, and even an old Anderson shelter behind it. Sundays featured a playful ritual where he and others had to edge along the wall through the kitchen because they were 'not allowed in' while his mum cooked Sunday dinner. In winter, he and his brother would get dressed in front of the gas fire to stay warm. His nan came regularly for Sunday dinners and stayed over at Christmas.",

That year he received Lego and built a 'money box' contraption with a slot on top and an exit slot so that if coins went through he kept them, and if they popped out the side they were returned. With his nan staying over Christmas, Tony went around 'extorting' small amounts of money in a good-natured way. He remembers his nan defeathering a turkey in the kitchen, his mum cooking, his dad present, and frequent play with his brother, including mock wrestling inspired by Sunday-afternoon TV and paging through the Freeman's catalogue imagining what they would buy from each page.",

She was consistently supportive of him even though he describes himself as an anxious, frightened child in relation to the wider world. He feels she taught him to be open and accepting of others and passed on a strong sense of morality and what matters in life. He remembers his dad as essentially a good, open, and giving man, despite a later period of fracture with his brother. A vivid memory is accidentally punching his dad in the mouth during play-fighting, knocking out a tooth and causing a bloody trip to the dentist, but not being punished—an example of the forgiving, accepting atmosphere at home.",
