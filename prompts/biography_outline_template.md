## Outline generation guidelines

- Use `data/autobiography/autobio_timeline.json` to:
  - Group events by period and theme.
  - Assign each event to one chapter, occasionally cross-referencing where needed.

- When generating a chapter:
  - Start with a short orienting paragraph.
  - Move through key events in a sensible order.
  - Keep paragraphs short and readable.

- Keep the voice:
  - First person (“I…”).
  - Conversational but not slangy.
  - Honest, not saccharine.

- Whenever the outline changes significantly:
  - Show a bullet-point list of chapters and which events moved where.
